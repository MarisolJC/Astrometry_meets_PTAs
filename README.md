# Measuring SGWB with Astrometry and PTAs

This repository contains the codes to calculate and visualise the Overlap Reduction Functions (ORFs) reported in 2412.14010.

The folder **pta_astro_MAPS** contains Jupyter notebooks to plot maps. If you have never used **Healpy** for visualisation, there are more detailed explanations in the notebook **ORFs_Visualisation.ipynb**.

--------- *This codes where runed with Python version 3.11.9, numpy 1.26.4, and jax 0.4.31* ---------
